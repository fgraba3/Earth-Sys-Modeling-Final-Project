Simulation of lake evaporation using an eddy diffusion model - Kylee Graham & Frank Graba
***
**Main Theme:**
The main theme of this paper is to accurately model evaporation and water level in lakes based on an eddy diffusion model. This can help us understand how climatic variations such as precipitation, cloud coverage, and temperature can impact water levels in lakes. This is important because lakes can serve as sources of drinking water, and a better understanding of this type of modeling can help predict when droughts would occur. Which would better prepare areas for limiting water usage for non-drinking activities. This type of modeling could also be used to predict when water levels are increasing due to low evaporation and to warn of flooding. Overall, this modeling is useful both for safety in terms of understanding periods of flooding or low levels of drinking water, as well as gaining a scientific understanding of how climatic variables affect lake evaporation.

**What Observations and Models are used by others that are different than what we are doing in the project:**
To simulate and interpret lake evaporation of Harney-Malheur Lake, Oregon, Hostetler & Bartlein (1990) use an eddy diffusion model. This model is used to understand the flow of fluid, in this case freshwater, due to eddy motion. The eddy diffusion model considers the thermal structure of lake water wherein seasonal temperature variability, heat storage, convection, turbulent mixing, and the surface energy balance must be accounted for (Hostetler & Bartlein 1990). Similarly, we will model evaporation of Harney-Malheur Lake using the eddy diffusion model as this model is numerically stable. Our model is different from Henderson-Sellers and Davies (1989) and McCormick and Meadows (1988) models for example are their models more centralize on mixed-layer modeling to simulate thermal stratification of lakes and shallow inland seas. While Hostetler & Bartlein (1990) focuses more on simulating lake temperatures and evaporation of different lakes, the other models consider atmosphere-ocean circulation climate models more generally (Henderson-Sellers and Davies (1989)).
